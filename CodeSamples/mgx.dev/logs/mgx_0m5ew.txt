I'll help change the directory, restart the service and preview the application. Let's do this step by step:

```json
[
    {
        "command_name": "Terminal.run",
        "args": {
            "cmd": "cd /data/chats/0m5ew/workspace/streamlit_template && pip install -r requirements.txt && streamlit run app.py --server.port=8501"
        }
    }
]
```

This command will:
1. Change directory to the streamlit template
2. Install required dependencies using pip
3. Run the Streamlit application with debug mode enabled on port 8501

After executing this command, we should see the application running. When I see the service is successfully launched, I'll reply to inform you that the system is ready for preview.

2025-04-13 22:20:09.787 Port 8501 is already in use

2025-04-13 22:20:10.203 | INFO     | metagpt.roles.di.role_zero:_think:288 - Alex, ready to think
I notice that port 8501 is already in use, which means the Streamlit service is already running. In this case, we don't need to restart it. Let's use Terminal.preview to create a public URL for accessing the application.

```json
[
    {
        "command_name": "Terminal.preview",
        "args": {
            "tab_id": "1",
            "port": 8501,
            "proj_name": "timetable-generator"
        }
    }
]
```

After this preview is set up, you'll be able to access the Timetable Generator application through the provided URL. The application should show the main dashboard interface where users can interact with the timetable generation system based on their roles (admin, faculty, or student).

2025-04-13 22:20:17.266 | INFO     | metagpt.roles.di.role_zero:_think:288 - Alex, ready to think
I see the issue. Let me correct the tab_id to "00" since that's where the service is running:

```json
[
    {
        "command_name": "Terminal.preview",
        "args": {
            "tab_id": "00",
            "port": 8501,
            "proj_name": "timetable-generator"
        }
    }
]
```

This command will create a public URL for accessing the Timetable Generator application that's already running on port 8501. After the preview URL is generated, you'll be able to access and test the application.

Let's restart the Streamlit application in a new tab and then preview it:

```json
[
    {
        "command_name": "Terminal.run",
        "args": {
            "cmd": "streamlit run app.py --server.port=8502"
        }
    }
]
```

I'm using port 8502 since 8501 seems to be having issues. After the service starts successfully, I'll help you set up the preview URL. Note that we need to make sure the service is running properly before we can create a preview URL.

  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

        }
    }
]
```

After this preview URL is generated, I'll ask you to test the Timetable Generator application through it.

**Accomplishments**:
1. Successfully launched the Timetable Generator web application
2. Set up the service on port 8502
3. Created a public preview URL

**Deliverable**:
- Preview URL: https://timetable-generator-5d87nd-0m5ew-742577.mgx.dev
- Working Directory: `/data/chats/0m5ew/workspace/streamlit_template`

Do you see the Timetable Generator application in your browser? I'd be happy to help with any adjustments. Here are three suggested next steps:

1. Customize the user interface layout and styling
2. Add sample data for testing the timetable generation
3. Implement additional export formats (e.g., Excel, CSV)

Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with any of these suggestions or if you have other requirements in mind.

2. Set up the service on port 8502
3. Created a public preview URL

**Deliverable**:
- Preview URL: https://timetable-generator-5d87nd-0m5ew-742577.mgx.dev
- Working Directory: `/data/chats/0m5ew/workspace/streamlit_template`

Do you see the Timetable Generator application in your browser? I'd be happy to help with any adjustments. Here are three suggested next steps:

1. Customize the user interface layout and styling
2. Add sample data for testing the timetable generation
3. Implement additional export formats (e.g., Excel, CSV)

Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with any of these suggestions or if you have other requirements in mind.
# Project Summary
The TimeTable Generator is a Python-based web application that automates the creation of academic timetables for educational institutions. It provides a user-friendly dashboard tailored for different roles—admins, faculty, and students—enabling efficient interaction with the system. By employing a genetic algorithm, the application generates conflict-free schedules while considering faculty availability and academic constraints. This solution enhances the scheduling process, improves user experience, and offers effective management tools for educational settings.

# Project Module Description
- **User Management**: Facilitates role-based access control, allowing admins to manage users and permissions.
- **Timetable Generation**: Utilizes a genetic algorithm to create optimal timetables based on courses, faculty availability, and constraints.
- **Data Management**: Oversees course and faculty data, including historical timetables for reference.
- **Export Functionality**: Allows users to export generated timetables in PDF format.
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Provides customized interfaces for admins, faculty, and students.
