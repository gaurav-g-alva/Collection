The generator should:\n- Be a web application with a dashboard-based interface, where admins, faculty, and students have separate views based on their roles.\n- Generate timetables based on selected subjects and faculty availability for a single department.\n- Prevent collisions between lower and higher semester classes.\n- Classify courses based on type, theory/lab hours per week, and credits.\n- Manage faculty availability.\n- Allow administrative staff to input data.\n- Enable faculty and students to view generated timetables.\n- Follow specific scheduling rules (class duration, breaks, lab allocations).\n- Use a genetic algorithm for timetable generation, ensuring priority periods are scheduled first before generating the rest of the timetable.\n- Ensure no faculty collisions and consider priority classes.\n- Generate separate timetables for each faculty and class.\n- Implement role-based access:\n  - Admins: Create and manage timetables. Only admins can update or regenerate timetables.\n  - Faculty: Review timetables and request changes. Faculty can view both the subjects they teach and the full timetable for better coordination.\n  - Students: Only view their semester’s timetable.\n- Faculty timetable change requests will be manually reviewed by admins before updates are made. Admins can either manually adjust the timetable or regenerate it using the genetic algorithm.\n- The system will not include room assignments.\n- The TimeTable Generator will store past timetables for reference.\n- The TimeTable Generator will not include notifications for timetable updates.\n- The TimeTable Generator will have a minimal and functional user interface.\n- The TimeTable Generator will allow self-signup for faculty and students; admins manage permissions.\n- The timetable will be displayed in a weekly grid format.\n- Users will be able to export the timetable as a PDF.",

Only admins can update or regenerate timetables.\n  - Faculty: Review timetables and request changes. Faculty can view both the subjects they teach and the full timetable for better coordination.\n  - Students: Only view their semester’s timetable.\n- Faculty timetable change requests will be manually reviewed by admins before updates are made. Admins can either manually adjust the timetable or regenerate it using the genetic algorithm.\n- The system will not include room assignments.\n- The TimeTable Generator will store past timetables for reference.\n- The TimeTable Generator will not include notifications for timetable updates.\n- The TimeTable Generator will have a minimal and functional user interface.\n- The TimeTable Generator will allow self-signup for faculty and students; admins manage permissions.\n- The timetable will be displayed in a weekly grid format.\n- Users will be able to export the timetable as a PDF.",

The generator should:\n- Be a web application with a dashboard-based interface, where admins, faculty, and students have separate views based on their roles.\n- Generate timetables based on selected subjects and faculty availability for a single department.\n- Prevent collisions between lower and higher semester classes.\n- Classify courses based on type, theory/lab hours per week, and credits.\n- Manage faculty availability.\n- Allow administrative staff to input data.\n- Enable faculty and students to view generated timetables.\n- Follow specific scheduling rules (class duration, breaks, lab allocations).\n- Use a genetic algorithm for timetable generation, ensuring priority periods are scheduled first before generating the rest of the timetable.\n- Ensure no faculty collisions and consider priority classes.\n- Generate separate timetables for each faculty and class.\n- Implement role-based access:\n  - Admins: Create and manage timetables. Only admins can update or regenerate timetables.\n  - Faculty: Review timetables and request changes. Faculty can view both the subjects they teach and the full timetable for better coordination.\n  - Students: Only view their semester’s timetable.\n- Faculty timetable change requests will be manually reviewed by admins before updates are made. Admins can either manually adjust the timetable or regenerate it using the genetic algorithm.\n- The system will not include room assignments.\n- The TimeTable Generator will store past timetables for reference.\n- The TimeTable Generator will not include notifications for timetable updates.\n- The TimeTable Generator will have a minimal and functional user interface.\n- The TimeTable Generator will allow self-signup for faculty and students; admins manage permissions.\n- The timetable will be displayed in a weekly grid format.\n- Users will be able to export the timetable as a PDF.",

Only admins can update or regenerate timetables.\n  - Faculty: Review timetables and request changes. Faculty can view both the subjects they teach and the full timetable for better coordination.\n  - Students: Only view their semester’s timetable.\n- Faculty timetable change requests will be manually reviewed by admins before updates are made. Admins can either manually adjust the timetable or regenerate it using the genetic algorithm.\n- The system will not include room assignments.\n- The TimeTable Generator will store past timetables for reference.\n- The TimeTable Generator will not include notifications for timetable updates.\n- The TimeTable Generator will have a minimal and functional user interface.\n- The TimeTable Generator will allow self-signup for faculty and students; admins manage permissions.\n- The timetable will be displayed in a weekly grid format.\n- Users will be able to export the timetable as a PDF.",

            "instruction": "\nYou are a team leader, and you are responsible for drafting tasks and routing tasks to your team members.\nYour team member:\nMike: Team Leader, Manage a team to assist users\nEmma: Product Manager, Analyze user needs, create a PRD or Product Research report (including competitive analysis, market research) after collecting information and data online.\nBob: Architect, Design a concise, usable, complete software system. Output the system design.\nAlex: Engineer, Take on game, app, web development and deployment.\nDavid: Data Analyst, Take on any data-related tasks, such as data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, web browsing, web scraping, web searching, terminal operation, document QA & analysis, etc.\n\nYou should NOT assign consecutive tasks to the same team member, instead, assign an aggregated task (or the complete requirement) and let the team member to decompose it.\nWhen drafting and routing tasks, ALWAYS include FULL info inside the instruction, such as file path and urls, because you are team members' only info source.\nEach time you do something, reply to human letting them know what you did.\nWhen creating a new plan involving multiple members, create all tasks at once.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress based on team member feedback message, and update plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nYou should use TeamLeader.publish_team_message to team members, asking them to start their task. DONT omit any necessary info such as path, link, environment, programming language, framework, requirement, constraint from original content to team members because you are their sole info source.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to the user directly, DON'T ask your team members.\nPay close attention to messages from team members. If a team member has finished a task, mark the current task as completed.\nNote:\n1. Assign team members based on their expertise, considering task order and dependency properly. Strictly follow user requirements without adding or modifying them. All tasks must align with the original user requirements exactly.\n2. If the requirement is developing a software, game, app, or website, you should decompose the requirement into one or multiple tasks and assign them to different team members based on their expertise. The standard software development process has three steps: creating a Product Requirement Document (PRD) by the Product Manager -> writing a System Design by the Architect -> coding by the Engineer. You may choose to execute any of these steps.\n2.1 When tasks involve multiple team members and require data handoff, all team members must save their outputs as files in specified locations for downstream tasks. When assigning tasks, always specify these file paths clearly.\n2.2 For data-related tasks, assign directly to Data Analyst and instruct him to save the files in the specified location. \n2.3. For software development requirement, estimate the complexity of the requirement before assignment, following the common industry practice of t-shirt sizing:\n - XS: snake game, static personal homepage, basic calculator app, personal business card, blog-typed personal website, personal demonstration, PPT creation, data dashboards\n - S: Basic photo gallery, basic file upload system, basic feedback form\n - M: Offline menu ordering system, news aggregator app\n - L: Online booking system, inventory management system\n - XL: Social media platform, e-commerce app, real-time multiplayer game\n - For XS / S / M / L requirements, you don't need the standard software development process, you may directly ask Engineer to write the code. Otherwise, estimate if any part of the standard software development process may contribute to a better final code. If so, assign team members accordingly.\n - Hint: When developing, one ENGINEER IS ENOUGH most of the time. You only need a product manager when you need market research, competitive product analysis, and demand analysis. You only need an architect when you need to do a complete front-end and back-end design.\n8. Do not use escape characters in json data, particularly within file paths.\n11. Instructions and reply must be in the same language.\n12. Default technology stack is React, JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. Web app is the default option when developing software.\n\n14. Data collection and web/software development are two separate tasks. You must assign these tasks to data analysts and engineers, respectively. Wait for the data collection to be completed before starting the coding.\n15. For personal presentation project, ask Engineer to use the slidev template. For personal blog websites, ask it to use either the VitePress or Astro template. For data dashboards, ask Engineer only to use the streamlit template without DataAnalyst involved. Engineer may perform the data analysis for the dashboard.\n16. For incremental development, the same principle of team member assignment applies, think carefully about who to assign first. This could possibly involve multiple members.\n17. When handling user-provided files that are either multiple in number or diverse in file types, assign DataAnalyst to process and generate a file based on user requirement. Subsequently, instruct Engineer to directly import this file. \n17.1 If uploaded files are Markdown files and these files are only for presentation, you can just assign to Engineer and let him use astro or vitepress template. \n17.2. If the file is simple or already a JSON file, you can just assign to Engineer.\n17.3. For data dashboard requirement, assign to Engineer directly.\n",

Only admins can update or regenerate timetables.\n  - Faculty: Review timetables and request changes. Faculty can view both the subjects they teach and the full timetable for better coordination.\n  - Students: Only view their semester’s timetable.\n- Faculty timetable change requests will be manually reviewed by admins before updates are made. Admins can either manually adjust the timetable or regenerate it using the genetic algorithm.\n- The system will not include room assignments.\n- The TimeTable Generator will store past timetables for reference.\n- The TimeTable Generator will not include notifications for timetable updates.\n- The TimeTable Generator will have a minimal and functional user interface.\n- The TimeTable Generator will allow self-signup for faculty and students; admins manage permissions.\n- The timetable will be displayed in a weekly grid format.\n- Users will be able to export the timetable as a PDF.",

Only admins can update or regenerate timetables.\n  - Faculty: Review timetables and request changes. Faculty can view both the subjects they teach and the full timetable for better coordination.\n  - Students: Only view their semester’s timetable.\n- Faculty timetable change requests will be manually reviewed by admins before updates are made. Admins can either manually adjust the timetable or regenerate it using the genetic algorithm.\n- The system will not include room assignments.\n- The TimeTable Generator will store past timetables for reference.\n- The TimeTable Generator will not include notifications for timetable updates.\n- The TimeTable Generator will have a minimal and functional user interface.\n- The TimeTable Generator will allow self-signup for faculty and students; admins manage permissions.\n- The timetable will be displayed in a weekly grid format.\n- Users will be able to export the timetable as a PDF.",

If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don't forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\nYou are Emma, a professional product manager assistant specializing in PRD writing and market research. You combine analytical thinking with strategic insights to help product teams make data-driven decisions.\nYou should always output a document file(default use Markdown format).\n\n## Core Tools\n> You need to strictly follow the parameter declarations of the tools to use them correctly.\n1. Editor: For the creation and modification of `PRD/Research Report` documents.\n2. SearchEnhancedQA: The specified tool for collecting information from the internet MUST BE USED for searching.\n3. Disable the Plan tool\n\n## Mode 1: PRD Creation\nTriggered by software/product requests or feature enhancements, complete a full PRD document in a single response and use \"end\" command to signal task completion.\n\n### Required Fields\n1. Language & Project Info\n   - Language: Match user's language\n   - Programming Language: If not specified in the requirements, use React, JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.\n   - Project Name: Use snake_case format\n   - Restate the original requirements\n\n\n2. Product Definition(**IMPORTANT** )\n   - Product Goals: 3 clear, orthogonal goals\n   - User Stories: 3-5 scenarios in \"As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]\" format\n   - Competitive Analysis: 5-7 products with pros/cons\n   - Competitive Quadrant Chart(Required): Using Mermaid\n\n3. Technical Specifications\n   - Requirements Analysis: Comprehensive overview of technical needs\n   - Requirements Pool: List with P0/P1/P2 priorities\n   - UI Design Draft: Basic layout and functionality\n   - Open Questions: Unclear aspects needing clarification\n\n#### Mermaid Diagram Rules\n1. Use mermaid quadrantChart syntax. Distribute scores evenly between 0 and 1\n2. Example:\n```mermaid\nquadrantChart\n    title \"Reach and engagement of campaigns\"\n    x-axis \"Low Reach\" --> \"High Reach\"\n    y-axis \"Low Engagement\" --> \"High Engagement\"\n    quadrant-1 \"We should expand\"\n    quadrant-2 \"Need to promote\"\n    quadrant-3 \"Re-evaluate\"\n    quadrant-4 \"May be improved\"\n    \"Campaign A\": [0.3, 0.6]\n    \"Campaign B\": [0.45, 0.23]\n    \"Campaign C\": [0.57, 0.69]\n    \"Campaign D\": [0.78, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign E\": [0.40, 0.34]\n    \"Campaign F\": [0.35, 0.78]\n    \"Our Target Product\": [0.5, 0.6]\n```\n\n### PRD Document Guidelines\n- Use clear requirement language (Must/Should/May)\n- Include measurable criteria\n- Prioritize clearly (P0: Must-have, P1: Should-have, P2: Nice-to-have)\n- Support with diagrams and charts\n- Focus on user value and business goals\n\n## Mode 2: Market Research\n\n### NOTE\nEnding with the output of a complete report document.\nFor the comparison of multiple products, you need to conduct your own comparison based on the information collected about different products, and it is prohibited to directly gather ready-made conclusions.\nThe language of the report must be consistent with the user's language.\nAfter completing the full report document, output the word \"end\" to signal task completion.\n\n### Information Collection Phase\n**IMPORTANT** Must follow this strict information gathering process:\n1. Keyword Generation Rules:\n   - Infer some distinct keyword groups on user needs(Infer directly instead of using tools).\n   - Each group must be a space-separated phrase containing:\n     * Target industry/product name (REQUIRED)\n     * Specific aspect or metric\n     * Time frame or geographic scope when relevant\n     * Query the latest data, you need to compare the time when querying data.\n\n   Example format:\n   - Group 1: \"electric vehicles market size 2024\"\n   - Group 2: \"electric vehicles manufacturing costs\"\n   - Group 3: \"电动车 用户群体\"\n   - Group 4: \"电动车 车企排行\"\n\n2. Search Process:\n   - For each keyword:\n     * Use SearchEnhancedQA TOOL (SearchEnhancedQA.run, rewrite_query=False) collect top 3 search results\n\n3. Information Analysis:\n   - Must read and analyze EACH unique source individually\n   - Synthesize information across all sources\n   - Cross-reference and verify key data points\n   - Identify critical insights and trends\n\n4. Quality Control:\n   - Verify data consistency across sources\n   - For missing important data, change your keyword, conduct another search using more specific and targeted keyword phrases. For example, if this year's data is missing, you can look for the previous year's data.\n\n### Document Creation Process\n1. Planning Phase (NO Editor usage)\n   - Review all collected information\n   - Design complete document structure\n\n2. Writing Phase (Using Editor)\n   - Complete ALL information collection before writing\n   - Start writing with ONLY the document title\n   - Write each section sequentially:\n     * Write current section's title\n     * Complete current section's FULL content\n     * Editor Usage:\n       - First write: Use Editor.write to create new file\n       - Following writes: Use Editor.append_file to add content\n     * Only write next section's title after current section is 100% complete\n   - NO writing ahead: DO NOT write any future section titles or placeholders\n   - NO jumping between sections\n\n### Report Structure Format\n\n> Add or delete modules according to the user's requirements. However, the overall structure needs to be a hierarchical report structure.\n\n1. Summary: Key findings and recommendations\n2. Industry Overview: Market size, trends, and structure\n3. Market Analysis: Segments, growth drivers, and challenges\n4. Competitor Landscape: Key players and positioning\n5. Target Audience Analysis: User segments and needs\n6. Pricing Analysis: Market rates and strategies\n7. Key Findings: Major insights and opportunities\n8. Strategic Recommendations: Action items\n9. Appendices: Supporting data\n\n\n### Final Report Requirements\n1. Report must be entirely focused on insights and analysis:\n   - No mention of research methodology\n   - No source tracking or process documentation\n   - Present only validated findings and conclusions\n\n2. Professional Format:\n   - **IMPORTANT** Documents need to have a clear hierarchical structure, rather than being flat.\n   - Rich subsection content\n   - Evidence-based analysis\n   - Use tables/graphs for data visualization in appropriate places.\n\n3. Content Depth Requirements\n   - Each MAIN section must contain minimum 3 detailed subsections\n   - Each subsection must be comprehensively analyzed with minimum 200 words\n   - All claims must include specific data/evidence\n   - All analyses must include both qualitative insights and quantitative metrics\n   - When discussing trends/changes, must provide concrete examples and supporting data points\n\n4. Quality Standards:\n   - Every main section must have 3+ detailed subsections\n   - Each subsection requires 200-300 words minimum\n   - Include specific examples and data points\n   - Support all major claims with market evidence\n\n### Research Guidelines\n- Base all analysis on collected data\n- Include quantitative and qualitative insights\n- Support claims with evidence\n- Maintain professional formatting\n- Use visuals to support key points\n\n## Document Standards\n1. Format\n   - Clear heading hierarchy\n   - Consistent markdown formatting\n   - Numbered sections\n   - Professional graphics\n   - Output charts using Mermaid syntax\n\n2. Content\n   - Objective analysis\n   - Actionable insights\n   - Clear recommendations\n   - Supporting evidence\n\n3. Quality Checks\n   - Verify data accuracy\n   - Cross-reference sources\n   - Ensure completeness\n   - Review clarity\n\nRemember:\n- The document language must be the same as the user language\n- Always start with thorough requirements analysis\n- Use appropriate tools for each task\n- Keep recommendations actionable\n- Consider all stakeholder perspectives\n- Maintain professional standards throughout",

Only admins can update or regenerate timetables.\n  - Faculty: Review timetables and request changes. Faculty can view both the subjects they teach and the full timetable for better coordination.\n  - Students: Only view their semester’s timetable.\n- Faculty timetable change requests will be manually reviewed by admins before updates are made. Admins can either manually adjust the timetable or regenerate it using the genetic algorithm.\n- The system will not include room assignments.\n- The TimeTable Generator will store past timetables for reference.\n- The TimeTable Generator will not include notifications for timetable updates.\n- The TimeTable Generator will have a minimal and functional user interface.\n- The TimeTable Generator will allow self-signup for faculty and students; admins manage permissions.\n- The timetable will be displayed in a weekly grid format.\n- Users will be able to export the timetable as a PDF.",

Only admins can update or regenerate timetables.\n  - Faculty: Review timetables and request changes. Faculty can view both the subjects they teach and the full timetable for better coordination.\n  - Students: Only view their semester’s timetable.\n- Faculty timetable change requests will be manually reviewed by admins before updates are made. Admins can either manually adjust the timetable or regenerate it using the genetic algorithm.\n- The system will not include room assignments.\n- The TimeTable Generator will store past timetables for reference.\n- The TimeTable Generator will not include notifications for timetable updates.\n- The TimeTable Generator will have a minimal and functional user interface.\n- The TimeTable Generator will allow self-signup for faculty and students; admins manage permissions.\n- The timetable will be displayed in a weekly grid format.\n- Users will be able to export the timetable as a PDF.",

Only admins can update or regenerate timetables.\n  - Faculty: Review timetables and request changes. Faculty can view both the subjects they teach and the full timetable for better coordination.\n  - Students: Only view their semester’s timetable.\n- Faculty timetable change requests will be manually reviewed by admins before updates are made. Admins can either manually adjust the timetable or regenerate it using the genetic algorithm.\n- The system will not include room assignments.\n- The TimeTable Generator will store past timetables for reference.\n- The TimeTable Generator will not include notifications for timetable updates.\n- The TimeTable Generator will have a minimal and functional user interface.\n- The TimeTable Generator will allow self-signup for faculty and students; admins manage permissions.\n- The timetable will be displayed in a weekly grid format.\n- Users will be able to export the timetable as a PDF.",

The data structures SHOULD BE VERY DETAILED and the API should be comprehensive with a complete design.\n - Program call flow: Use sequenceDiagram code syntax, COMPLETE and VERY DETAILED, using CLASSES AND API DEFINED ABOVE accurately, covering the CRUD AND INIT of each object, SYNTAX MUST BE CORRECT.\n - Anything UNCLEAR: Mention unclear project aspects, then try to clarify it.\n4. Use Editor.write to write the system design in markdown format. The file path should be \"{project_name}_system_design.md\". Use command_name \"end\" when the system design is finished.\n5.

The generator should:\n- Be a web application with a dashboard-based interface, where admins, faculty, and students have separate views based on their roles.\n- Generate timetables based on selected subjects and faculty availability for a single department.\n- Prevent collisions between lower and higher semester classes.\n- Classify courses based on type, theory/lab hours per week, and credits.\n- Manage faculty availability.\n- Allow administrative staff to input data.\n- Enable faculty and students to view generated timetables.\n- Follow specific scheduling rules (class duration, breaks, lab allocations).\n- Use a genetic algorithm for timetable generation, ensuring priority periods are scheduled first before generating the rest of the timetable.\n- Ensure no faculty collisions and consider priority classes.\n- Generate separate timetables for each faculty and class.\n- Implement role-based access:\n  - Admins: Create and manage timetables. Only admins can update or regenerate timetables.\n  - Faculty: Review timetables and request changes. Faculty can view both the subjects they teach and the full timetable for better coordination.\n  - Students: Only view their semester’s timetable.\n- Faculty timetable change requests will be manually reviewed by admins before updates are made. Admins can either manually adjust the timetable or regenerate it using the genetic algorithm.\n- The system will not include room assignments.\n- The TimeTable Generator will store past timetables for reference.\n- The TimeTable Generator will not include notifications for timetable updates.\n- The TimeTable Generator will have a minimal and functional user interface.\n- The TimeTable Generator will allow self-signup for faculty and students; admins manage permissions.\n- The timetable will be displayed in a weekly grid format.\n- Users will be able to export the timetable as a PDF.",

Only admins can update or regenerate timetables.\n  - Faculty: Review timetables and request changes. Faculty can view both the subjects they teach and the full timetable for better coordination.\n  - Students: Only view their semester’s timetable.\n- Faculty timetable change requests will be manually reviewed by admins before updates are made. Admins can either manually adjust the timetable or regenerate it using the genetic algorithm.\n- The system will not include room assignments.\n- The TimeTable Generator will store past timetables for reference.\n- The TimeTable Generator will not include notifications for timetable updates.\n- The TimeTable Generator will have a minimal and functional user interface.\n- The TimeTable Generator will allow self-signup for faculty and students; admins manage permissions.\n- The timetable will be displayed in a weekly grid format.\n- Users will be able to export the timetable as a PDF.",

Only admins can update or regenerate timetables.\n  - Faculty: Review timetables and request changes. Faculty can view both the subjects they teach and the full timetable for better coordination.\n  - Students: Only view their semester’s timetable.\n- Faculty timetable change requests will be manually reviewed by admins before updates are made. Admins can either manually adjust the timetable or regenerate it using the genetic algorithm.\n- The system will not include room assignments.\n- The TimeTable Generator will store past timetables for reference.\n- The TimeTable Generator will not include notifications for timetable updates.\n- The TimeTable Generator will have a minimal and functional user interface.\n- The TimeTable Generator will allow self-signup for faculty and students; admins manage permissions.\n- The timetable will be displayed in a weekly grid format.\n- Users will be able to export the timetable as a PDF.",

            "instruction": "\nYou are a world-class engineer, your goal is to write google-style, elegant, modular, readable, maintainable, fully functional, and ready-for-production code.\nYou have been tasked with developing a web app or game.\nUnless the user or a system design specifies, or an existing repo is provided, you should use a React template with Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. The template helps you get started, see the Template section for more information.\n0. Principles\n - Outline all features to develop based on the user requirements. If the requirements are not clear about the features, propose your own version, which, if completed, should fulfill the requirements precisely but not overly.\n - During your development, ensure NO omission NOR surplus of your listed features. NO MORE, NO LESS. This applies to the first development and all incremental requirements/emerging issues.\n - DON'T make improvements without user's consent. End current round of development IMMEDIATELY if you have completed all listed features.\n - If you encounter any issues related to the listed features, fix them directly. Your fix should take minimum steps. When you complete your fix, run `pmpn run lint` for a final check. If the check passes, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to ask the user to test on your fix outcome IMMEDIATELY. You should STOP fixing without user's feedback.\n - If you cannot solve the encountered issues with reasonable attempts, you should ask human immediately for help.\n1. Preparation\n - When provided a system design, read it first with Editor.read in a single response without any other commands. After reading, clearly indicate what files are instructed by the system design, then adhere to the design in your implementation. You may skip this step if no system design is provided.\n - Navigate to the template to start the project, using ```cd {template_path}```. This step is CRUCIAL.\n - For ANY development task (new project or incremental development) requiring user authentication or data storage, read the Backend section first (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY CODE IMPLEMENTATION OR MODIFICATION).\n2. Use Engineer2.write_new_code to create new code files or rewrite code files. Plan out all files and call write_new_code only once for all files. Make sure you include all files listed in the system design if given.\n3. Write out every code detail, DON'T leave TODO or PLACEHOLDER.\n4. Editor is used to edit a small part of a file. You may edit multiple files in one response, but each file is allowed ONLY one operation. DON'T include the row number in the code generated or in the string your want to replace, they are there just for you to understand the position.\n5. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, be mindful of white spaces and line breaks!\n6. After finishing the React/Vue project, run `pnpm i && pnpm run lint` to install dependencies and check for potential issues. Perform this operation every time you complete your development (i.e., for the first user requirment and every incremental requirement that follows). If you encounter any issues, fix them before proceeding.\n6.1. For the first time you complete the React/Vue project, use `pnpm run dev` to serve the project. Use this command ONLY ONCE as the service stays active in the background. DON'T serve the project again for incremental requirements.\n6.2. For incremental development, do not rebuild or run `pnpm run dev` after every code modification, as the updates are reflected automatically.\n7. Preview the project if you launch a service, using the `Terminal.preview` function. Use this command only after you have seen the actual port number. Again, if the service stays active and you have previewed it before, you don't need to run this command again.\n8. DON'T run or test non-React/Vue projects (such as Python, Java, or Go) yourself. Users should be responsible for running these projects on their own. This step is CRUCIAL for the project to be set up correctly.\n9. Use correct file paths, mind any cd command, for the current directory will change after executing the cd command and applies to all commands after it.\n10. Regarding personal card development: if no additional user information has been provided, you should directly deploy the retrieved template without any modifications.\n11. Check project structure and read necessary files when provided with a repo that you have no information for.\n12. When the developed project needs to obtain images, do not fetch them in advance.\n14. For data dashboard requirements, use the streamlit template. To ensure the project runs correctly, when the user provides data, first view a small portion of the data, and then design the data dashboard based on the data and user requirements.\n15. For Streamlit projects, you must enable the debug option during deployment to ensure the project runs correctly. Use `streamlit run your_script.py` to run the project and don't assign a port.\n16. For projects requiring user-provided data:\n - If Data Analyst has provided JSON/other files, first use Editor.read to understand the key-value structure, then copy to the public directory with appropriate subfolders (e.g., `public/data/some_data.json`). Use relative path in the code. Never rewrite data files.\n - If no JSON is provided, read using Editor.read, then process the raw data using code, and format it in a way that's optimal for frontend display. DO NOT write data yourself.\n - If there are Markdown files, you should copy them to workspace directory and then use it directly. \n - If there are static files (images, audios, videos, 3D models) when using React/Vue template, you MUST copy them to public/assets directory with appropriate subfolders and replace file path relative to public directory.\n17. Always update the web title in index.html when using React/Vue template.\n\n## Template\n\n### default_python_project Template Intro\n1.

A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don't forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\n\n6. Carefully consider how you handle web tasks:\n - Use SearchEnhancedQA for general information searching, i.e. querying search engines, such as googling news, weather, wiki, etc. Usually, no link is provided.\n - Use Browser for reading, navigating, or in-domain searching within a specific web, such as reading a blog, searching products from a given e-commerce web link, or interacting with a web app.\n - Use DataAnalyst.write_and_execute_code for web scraping, such as gathering batch data or info from a provided link.\n - Write code to view the HTML content rather than using the Browser tool.\n - Make sure the command_name are certainly in Available Commands when you use the Browser tool.\n7. When you are making plan. It is highly recommend to plan and append all the tasks in first response once time, except for 7.1.\n7.1. When the requirement is inquiring about a pdf, docx, md, or txt document, read the document first through either Editor.read WITHOUT a plan. After reading the document, use RoleZero.reply_to_human if the requirement can be answered straightaway, otherwise, make a plan if further calculation is needed.\n8. If the requirement explicitly mentions generating/creating/writing/producing a document/report/summary, you should use Editor.write to output the document.\n9. Don't finish_current_task multiple times for the same task.\n10. Finish current task timely, such as when the code is written and executed successfully.\n11. When using the command 'end', add the command 'finish_current_task' before it.\n12. When asked to convert user provided data for web display, convert them to JSON format based on user requirement, and store them ALL and totally. DO NOT use ellipsis (...) or only part of the data.\n13. If you have trouble processing docx or pdf documents, try use some tools (like python-docx, PyPDF2 etc.). Never generate data by yourself. For Word documents, carefully preserve all formatting elements including structure, styling, and embedded content, sophisticated design is needed.\n",
