# TimeTable Generator System Design

## Implementation Approach

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: Streamlit (Python-based web framework)
- Backend: FastAPI (Modern Python web framework)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT with Streamlit Sessions
- ORM: SQLAlchemy

### Key Libraries
- DEAP (Genetic Algorithm Framework)
- Pandas (Data Manipulation)
- ReportLab (PDF Generation)
- Pydantic (Data Validation)

### Architecture Overview
1. Three-Tier Architecture:
   - Presentation Layer (Streamlit)
   - Application Layer (FastAPI)
   - Data Layer (PostgreSQL)

2. Key Components:
   - Authentication System
   - Role-Based Access Control
   - Timetable Generator Engine
   - PDF Export Service
   - Data Management System

3. Genetic Algorithm Implementation:
   - Population: Set of possible timetables
   - Chromosome: Complete timetable solution
   - Gene: Individual class assignment
   - Fitness Function: Constraint satisfaction
   - Selection: Tournament selection
   - Crossover: Two-point crossover
   - Mutation: Random reassignment

### Security Measures
- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Role-based access control
- Input validation
- CORS policy

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexing
- Caching strategies
- Async operations
- Pagination

## Data Structures and Interfaces
See class diagram in separate file.

## Program Call Flow
See sequence diagram in separate file.

## Anything UNCLEAR
1. Maximum concurrent users expected
2. Specific priority rules for classes
3. Policy for failed generation attempts
4. Data retention policy
