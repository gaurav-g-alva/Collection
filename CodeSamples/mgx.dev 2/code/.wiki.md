# Project Summary
The TimeTable Generator is a Python-based web application designed to automate the creation of academic timetables. It features a dashboard interface tailored for different user roles—admins, faculty, and students—allowing them to interact with the system based on their specific needs. The application employs a genetic algorithm to generate conflict-free schedules while managing faculty availability and adhering to academic constraints. This solution aims to streamline the scheduling process, enhance user experience, and provide efficient management tools for educational institutions.

# Project Module Description
- **User Management**: Handles role-based access control, allowing admins to manage users and their permissions.
- **Timetable Generation**: Uses a genetic algorithm to create efficient timetables based on courses, faculty availability, and predefined constraints.
- **Data Management**: Manages course and faculty data, including historical timetables for reference.
- **Export Functionality**: Enables users to export generated timetables in PDF format.
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Provides tailored interfaces for admins, faculty, and students.
